# Algorithms 9 : Dijkstra's versus Prim's Algorithm
From what you've seen and read about Dijkstra's Algorithm, pick an example to demonstrate where you would use Dijkstra's to solve an algorithm.   From you pseudo-code, turn this into a program using the language of your choice.    

In the same way, pick an example of where you would use Prim's algorithm.  Turn this into a pseudo-code algorithm.  Turn this algorithms into a program using your language of choice. 

 Please upload both p-code and program for each.
