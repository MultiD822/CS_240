# Algorithms 5: Hash functions
You will build the following algorithms in the programming language of your choice. 

## Horner's Method
Implement a hash function that takes in a string key and returns an integer index. Your hash function should use the Horner's method to compute the hash value and convert the character code to its unicode code. Do not use ASCII.  This function should work with any language. The base and mod can be adjusted as a parameter based to this function.

You will be using this in your hash table implementation.
