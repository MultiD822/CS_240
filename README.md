# CS 240 Class: Data Structures & Algorithms
  Welcome to my CS 240 repository! In this class, I am diving deep into the world of data structures and algorithms. 
    From fundamental linear and binary search algorithms to more complex concepts like linked lists and arrays, 
    I am on a journey to enhance my understanding of these crucial aspects of computer science.
    
## Goals Of the Class
- Learn and implement 10 different algorithms.
- Understand and build 5 essential data structures.
- Analyze the runtime performance of code segments & the operations using big-O notation.
- Design and use hash tables appropriately in solving coding problems.
- Implement recursive and non-recursive algorithms like (construct, insert, delete, search, and traverse) to manipulate heaps.
- Use heaps appropriately in solving problems.
- Compare and contrast sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms
1. [Algorithm]: Binary Search, Time Complexity
2. [Algorithm]: Insertion & Selection Sort
3. [Algorithm]: Recursion vs Iteration
4. [Algorithm]: Mergesort & Quicksort
5. [Algorithm]: Hash functions
6. [Algorithm]: Binary Trees - Search and Sort


## Data Structures
1. [Data Structure]: Linked Lists
2. [Data Structure]: Stacks and Queues
3. [Data Structure]: Hash tables


## Progress
I will be updating this repository regularly to showcase my progress in understanding these algorithms and data structures. 
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions.


## Resources
Will add resources when I have enough good ones  ðŸ’½

## Personal Notes
Also, if you are having a hard time with puzzles, try doing a simpler puzzle that is more fun and silly. 
  Then, come back to the hard puzzle, and you might find it easier to solve with fresh eyes.
