# Algorithms HW 4: Mergesort & Quicksort
This assignment focuses on implementing and understanding two popular sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort. The tasks include writing pseudo code and actual code for both algorithms, explaining their workings through comments, comparing their time complexities in best, average, and worst-case scenarios, and finally, verifying the correctness of the implementations using a provided file.
## Details
1. Write in pseudo code a merge sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

3. Write in the programming language of your choice a merge sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

4. Write in pseudo code a quick sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

5. Write in the programming language of your choice a quick sort algorithm that works over an array. Comment to explain the algorithm.

6. How do the best, average, and worst-case time complexities compare between these two algorithms? 

7. Use the uploaded file to verify your sort algorithms are working. numbers-4.txt.  What is the position of 90262? What is the position of 11559?
