# Algorithms HW 4: Mergesort & Quicksort
This assignment focuses on implementing and understanding two popular sorting algorithms: merge sort and quick sort. The tasks include writing pseudo code and actual code for both algorithms, explaining their workings through comments, comparing their time complexities in best, average, and worst-case scenarios, and finally, verifying the correctness of the implementations using a provided file.
